It's all kinds of fun using a ton of different tools
to crack passwords, and then having to sort and go through
and maintain or delete them... right?

This project will hopefully be a very modular front
end to cracking passwords. The idea is you tell it a tool
to use and how to use it, and what to expect in results.
The the overlying framework should swallow that up
and allow you to upload / crack and manaage password,
hash, and dictionary collections. Allowing you to
look back historically at what was cracked, and with
what tool, resend a group through the engines again
have as many engines as you want etc...

If I can keep the idea as scalable as possible, I
think it would fit really well plugged into any
pentester/red teamer/ or firm's toolkit

Also, I picked the name based on where Jack the Ripper
was performing his murders... seems a bit dark now
that I think about it, but oh well...
