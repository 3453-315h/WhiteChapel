Notes::

It's all kinds of fun using a ton of different tools
to crack passwords, and then having to sort and go through
and maintain or delete them... right?

This project will hopefully be a very modular front
end to cracking passwords. The idea is you tell it a tool
to use and how to use it, and what to expect in results.
The the overlying framework should swallow that up
and allow you to upload / crack and manage passwords,
hashs, and dictionary collections. Allowing you to
look back historically at what was cracked, and with
what tool, resend a group through the engines again
have as many engines as you want etc... Giving you
more time to concentrate on using the passwords instead
of figuring out the tools to break them.

If I can keep the idea as scalable as possible, I
think it would fit really well plugged into any
pentester/red teamer/ or firm's toolkit

Also, I picked the name based on where Jack the Ripper
was performing his murders... seems a bit dark now
that I think about it, but oh well...
